First, some research deals with block-scheduling\u2014the reallocation of fixed amounts of classroom time into longer blocks for some subjects. Implemented at the high school level, the block schedule is designed to allow for more variety in instructional formats, encourage more active teaching strategies, decrease disruptions during the school day, and ultimately better prepare students for college work (Rice, Croninger, and Roellke 2002; Hughes, Jr.", "Figures 2 and 3 present point estimates (with 95 percent confidence intervals) from simple regressions designed to capture intertemporal effects.35 Two lead indicators, an indicator for the year a schedule change took place, and three lag indicators are considered as independent variables in a regression that also includes school fixed effects and year effects.36 The omitted category is three-plus years before a schedule change occurred.

Therefore, the second motivation for this work is to assess the academic impacts of the four-day school week for high school students. High school academic outcomes are of particular interest to the long-term well-being of students as these outcomes may impact college-going behavior and early-career labor market outcomes (Murnane, Willett, and Levy, 1995; Grogger and Eide, 1995; Rose, 2006; Cho, 2007).", "Rural school districts that are able to maintain time in school as a result of the switch to the four-day school week could continue to maintain a districtwide model without much impact on students\u2019 academic outcomes, regardless of grade level. However, there are other factors to consider in weighing this decision. Most notably, as evidenced by our findings on absences, having students acclimated to a four-day school week prior to high school, as in the districtwide model, may help ease the transition from middle school to high school in terms of academic engagement.", "First, adolescent students could be negatively impacted by the earlier school start times associated with these four-day school weeks (Carrell, Maghakian, and West, 2011; Heissel and Norris, 2018). Moreover, these findings may reflect greater learning impacts of lost instruction due to the more rigorous high school curriculum and that students\u2019 home environments may be less equipped to facilitate off-day engagement with the more rigorous coursework in these grade levels compared to younger students.", "Four-day school week schedules are being adopted with increasing frequency, particularly in rural areas. In this paper we consider the academic implications of students in Oregon attending a four-day school week for the first time when they enter high school.", "In other words, many high school students in rural areas likely would have missed some instructional time each week even in the absence of the four-day school week due travel to extracurricular activities (e.g., sporting events) or appointments (e.g., medical, dental).15 This suggests that overall exposure may not change as dramatically for students in these districts, even if overall time in school is reduced as a result of the change to the four-day school week. Given closer proximity to these activities or appointments in non-rural areas, the switch to the four-day school week may yield more substantial reductions in time in school, leading to detrimental achievement impacts \u2013 a similar phenomenon to what was observed for primary school student achievement (Thompson, 2021b).", "This context highlights a potentially important trade-off for school district officials in these non-rural settings to consider when making decisions about four-day school week adoption and implementation: whether expected teacher quality gains from this increased non-monetary benefit of a three-day weekend would offset these achievement losses over the longer-run.
